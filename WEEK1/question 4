Project URL: https://github.com/saurabhhirugade/Mini-Voting-System

Structures:
- struct currentValidID: Stores election year, branch code, and total number of voters.
- typedef struct candidate: Defines candidate ID (cid), name (cname), and vote count.

Global Variables:
- candidateArray[20]: Stores up to 20 candidate records.
- studentVotes[200]: Records student roll numbers who have voted.
- currentValidID: Election-specific metadata.
- numberOfCandidates: Tracks how many candidates are registered.

Core Functions:

1. Student ID Parsing and Validation:
- extractYear(): Extracts year from student ID.
- extractRollNo(): Extracts roll number.
- checkBranchCode(): Validates the branch prefix in ID.

2. Admin Panel Functions:
- authenticateAdmin(): Verifies admin login credentials.
- adminPanel(): Displays admin options like start election, ban IDs, delete votes, and view results.

3. Voting Logic and Validation:
- studentPanel(): Manages student voting flow.
- isValid(): Validates student ID format and eligibility.
- isVoted(): Checks if a student has already voted.
- isBanned(): Checks if a student is banned from voting.
- saveVote(): Records a valid vote and updates candidate data.

4. Election Control and File Operations:
- deleteIllegalVote(): Removes invalid votes from candidate files.
- banID(): Flags student roll numbers as banned and logs them.
- createCandidateFiles(): Initializes individual candidate vote files.
- saveElectionInfoInFile(): Persists election metadata and candidate records.
- loadElectionInfoFromFile(): Reloads saved election data and candidates.

5. Result Processing:
- getWinner(): Calculates winner based on highest votes or declares a tie.

Program Flow:
- Admin logs in and sets up the election.
- Students enter ID to vote, which is validated and checked against ban/vote lists.
- If eligible, vote is cast and stored.
- Admin can manage voting records and monitor election progress.
- Final results are displayed with vote counts and winner.
